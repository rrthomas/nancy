Add support for patches with diff. This is an alternative to Nancy syntax for files that can't be edited, and must be used as pristine sources.

Want to use this for "Recalled Home", but that has the files in the wrong structure: the poetry archive is a submodule (hence subdirectory). To fix this, generalize nancy so the path argument is a list of directories which are searched in order, and --root is removed.

Then have a separate utility that takes the old PATH argument and --root option, and outputs suitable arguments for new nancy.
